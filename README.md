2. functionality to send a new chat message

### Extensions

### <a name="ideas"></a> Ideas for Improvement

Here are some ideas for this app that could be extended:

* Integrate bot
* Categorize a chat as important, 'remind me' feature etc ...
* Use [HTML Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API)
Examples as shown in [DnD for File Uploading](https://css-tricks.com/drag-and-drop-file-uploading/) and [DnD for Car Parking Game](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-parking-game-with-the-html-drag-and-drop-api/). [React-Dropzone] (https://css-tricks.com/image-upload-manipulation-react/)
